To set it globally for all users on the machine, : npm config set loglevel info --global.



The levels are: silent, win, error, warn, info, verbose, and silly.
silent: completely silent. Zero logging output.
win: Just the “npm ok” or “npm not ok” message at the end.
error: When something unexpected and bad happens.
warn: When something odd or potentially dangerous is happening.
info: Helpful information so you can track what’s happening.
verbose: Even more. Perhaps just a wee bit obnoxious, even.
silly: Completely crazy.Dump everything. Whole objects.
